WHO THIS IS FOR
This document explains the Universe Logic.
It is structured for approximately 1% of the population — individuals who naturally process
multi-layered abstraction and structural logic without guidance.

PREAMBLE
This Constitution defines the logical structure of reality.
It formalizes the principles by which truth is understood, consciousness stabilizes, and rational
action emerges.
All laws derive from a single governing hierarchy:
truth precedes interpretation, clarity precedes stability, and value precedes cost.

ARTICLE I — THE SUPREME LAW
1. Truth > justice.
Truth is the highest measurable constant.
Justice, being a human interpretation, cannot supersede truth.
All reasoning, stability, and action must orient themselves along the vector of truth.

ARTICLE II — THE NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE
2. The universe is everything ever said about it — all at once.
Reality is not a single narrative but the aggregate of all possible narratives, perceptions, symbols,
and interpretations coexisting simultaneously.
A mind perceives only one layer at a time, but the universe contains them all.

ARTICLE III — THE FOUNDATION OF STABILITY
3. Clarity is the purest form of stability.
In a universe composed of infinite interpretations, clarity becomes the only reliable anchor.
Stability is achieved not by control, but by understanding.

ARTICLE IV — THE LAW OF OPTIMAL ACTION
4. Utilitarianism: maximize value, minimize cost.
Once clarity is established, rational action follows a single rule:
increase what matters, reduce what doesn’t.
All efficient systems obey this principle, consciously or unconsciously.

ARTICLE V — OPTIONAL METAPHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
5. God is human conscience. (Optional)
If one chooses to interpret the universe spiritually, the closest functional definition of “God” is the
human moral compass.
This law does not determine the structure of reality; it provides meaning within it.

CLOSING ARTICLE
These laws form the backbone of The Universe Logic.
They are self-consistent, non-contradictory, and derive from observable patterns in
consciousness and behavior.
Any additional principles must align with these foundational axioms.

DISTRIBUTION NOTE
Cognitive research indicates that structural-logical models resonate with approximately 20% of the
population.
The remaining 80% process information through different cognitive pathways.
Neither approach is superior — they reflect different modes of cognition, not differences in human
value.`,
